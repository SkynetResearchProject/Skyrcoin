Forked from peony 4.0.0.1.
v2.0.0.9-cs

Added Cold Staking features from PIVX v4.2.0 (same code from QRAX).
This is a critical update. In wallets version 2.0.0.8, synchronization will be disabled after Cold Staking is enabled and the first CS reward block is created.
For more information see topic <a href="https://forum.pivx.org/threads/a-pivx-cold-staking-how-to.745/">A PIVX Cold Staking How-To</a>
Set staking=1 and coldstaking=1 in file skyrcoin.conf of staker wallet (this needs to be online 24/7). Staker wallet balance balance can be zero.
